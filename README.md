### Building a project with SUGDK

There are two ways you can build a project using SUGDK
  1. You can use a compiled .jar version of the source or
  2. You can fork a stable build of SUGDK to build your project around.  By doing it this way you'll already have a structured folder setup for your project that's compatible with SUGDK's data referencing.
